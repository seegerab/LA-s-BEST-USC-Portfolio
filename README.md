# LA's BEST USC 

I participated in the Los Angeles Biostatistics Education Program at the University of Southern California [LA's BEST @ USC] (https://lasbest.usc.edu/about/) during the summer of 2021.

Through this program, I recieved formal training in biostatistics from experts at USC. 

Along with Melissa Gomez, Luke Hall, and Jean-Hus Theodore, I completed a data science project entitled "Risk Factors Associated with Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV1) and Asthma Frequency in the Southern California CHS Study". We presented our findings in a poster session at the end of the internship.

In this repository, you'll find several R scripts that include our analysis, as well as a .pdf file of our poster.
